# NIX-CPP-Compatibility-Check

## Work-In-Progess
This project is a fork of a github project containing another github project, that are both used to provide a streamlined way of making Cpp (and maybe C) projects with VSCode on NixOS, parts of the project can be used to make a project on any operating system.
